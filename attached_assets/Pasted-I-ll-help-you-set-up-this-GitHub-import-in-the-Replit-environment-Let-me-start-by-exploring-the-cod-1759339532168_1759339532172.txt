I'll help you set up this GitHub import in the Replit environment. Let me start by exploring the codebase to understand its structure, build system, and requirements.
Opened replit.md
Now let me check the vite config and server setup to understand the architecture better:
Opened drizzle.config.ts
Let me check the database schema and understand if there's a backend server setup:
Opened shared/schema.ts
Opened server/routes.ts
Now I understand the project structure. This is a full-stack PDF text extraction application with:
•	Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite on port 5000
•	Backend: Express server (also on port 5000 in full mode)
•	Database: PostgreSQL (needs to be provisioned)
Let me check if there's a vite.ts file for the server and understand the full setup:
Opened server/vite.ts
Opened server/storage.ts
Now I need to check the db.ts and understand the configuration:
Opened server/db.ts
Opened server/services directory
Now I understand the complete setup. Let me create a task list and start configuring this project for Replit:
I can see there's already a workflow that failed. Let me first provision the database:
Created PostgreSQL database
Good! Database is provisioned. Now let me run the database migration and create the uploads directory:
Executed npm run db:push
I need to install dependencies first. Let me try with npx:
Executed npx drizzle-kit push
Let me check the node_modules and package lock to see if dependencies are installed:
Executed ls -la node_modules 2>/dev/null | head -n 5 || echo "node_modules not found"
I need to install npm packages. Let me check what package manager is being used:
Executed which npm && which bun
Good, both npm and bun are available. Let me install dependencies:
Executed npm install
Great! Dependencies installed and LSP errors reduced significantly. Now let me push the database schema and create the uploads directory:
Executed npm run db:push
Executed mkdir -p uploads && echo "uploads directory created"
Perfect! Database schema is pushed and uploads directory created. Let me update the task list and configure the workflow. First, let me check the middleware upload configuration:
Opened server/middleware/upload.ts
Good, the upload directory is auto-created. Now let me update the task list and configure the workflow:
Set up data storage for app
Create app structure in storage
Make folder for storing files
Now let me configure the workflow. Based on the package.json, the full-stack application runs with dev:full which starts both frontend and backend. Let me set this up:
Configured Start application to run npm run dev:full
The workflow failed. Let me check the logs to see what went wrong:
Checked system logs
I see the issue - it's trying to import from server/shared/schema.js but the schema is in shared/schema.ts. Let me check the import in aiProvider.ts:
Executed rg -n 'from.*schema' server/services
I see the issue - all the server files are using incorrect import paths ../shared/schema.js when it should be ../../shared/schema.js (need to go up two directories from server/services). Let me fix all these imports:
Let me read the files first and then fix them:
Opened server/services/enhancedOcrProvider.ts
Now let me fix all the import paths:
Edited server/services/enhancedOcrProvider.ts
Great! The import paths are fixed and LSP errors reduced significantly. Now let me restart the workflow:
Restarted Start application
Let me check the logs again:
Checked system logs
The issue is a missing package 'pdf-parse-debugging-disabled'. Let me check what packages are needed and search for the correct package name:
Executed npm list pdf-parse 2>/dev/null || echo "pdf-parse not found"
I need to install the missing pdf-parse package. Let me check what it should be:
Executed npm search pdf-parse --json 2>/dev/null | head -n 50 || npm search pdf-parse 2>&1 | head -n 10
The package 'pdf-parse-debugging-disabled' doesn't exist. I need to use 'pdf-parse' instead. Let me install it and fix the import:
Installed pdf-parse
Now let me fix the import in aiProvider.ts:
Opened server/services/aiProvider.ts
Edited server/services/aiProvider.ts
Good! Now let me restart the workflow again:
Restarted Start application
Checked system logs
The pdf-parse package is trying to load a test file at startup. This is a bug in the pdf-parse package. Let me use a different fork that doesn't have this issue:
Uninstalled pdf-parse
Installed pdf-parse-fork
Now update the import to use pdf-parse-fork:
Edited server/services/aiProvider.ts
Now let me restart the workflow:
Restarted Start application
Checked system logs
I see the issue - there's a path matching error with the '*' pattern. This is happening in the vite.ts setup. The Express 5.x has changed the way it handles paths. Let me check the vite.ts file more carefully:
Opened server/vite.ts
The issue is that Express 5.x doesn't support the * glob pattern anymore. I need to use a regex or different pattern. Let me fix this:
Edited server/vite.ts
Now let me also check and fix the serveStatic function:
Opened server/vite.ts
Edited server/vite.ts
Now let me also check if there's a client folder since the vite.ts references a client/index.html file:
Executed ls -la | grep -E "(client|index.html)"
The index.html is in the root directory, not in a client folder. Let me fix the path in vite.ts:
Edited server/vite.ts
Now let me restart the workflow:
Restarted Start application
Checked system logs
Express 5.x doesn't support wildcards like /* in app.use(). I need to use a different approach. Let me change to use a regular expression or a middleware that handles all routes:
Edited server/vite.ts
Edited server/vite.ts
Now let me restart the workflow again:
Restarted Start application
Great! The workflow started. Let me check the logs to make sure it's running properly:
Checked system logs
The server is starting but Vite can't find some components. The imports in the tsx files are using path aliases that aren't resolving. Let me check if there are missing components:
Executed ls -la src/components/ui/ | grep -E "(toaster|sonner|tooltip)" || echo "Some components missing"
The components exist. The issue is that Vite is not finding them because it's looking for them during HMR. Let me check the PDFViewer component:
Executed ls -la src/components/ | grep -i pdf
The components exist. The issue appears to be during Vite's HMR/transformation phase. This is likely a temporary error during startup. Let me wait a moment and check if it stabilizes. Let me also check the App.tsx to see the imports:
Opened src/App.tsx
Let me wait a moment and check the logs again to see if the app eventually starts:
Executed sleep 3 && curl -s http://localhost:5000 > /dev/null && echo "Server is responding" || echo "Server not responding"
The server is crashing. Let me check if there's a tsconfig path mapping issue. Let me check the tsconfig:
Opened tsconfig.json
Opened tsconfig.app.json
The tsconfig paths look fine. The issue is that Vite is having trouble during the initial startup/transformation. Looking back at the error message, it says the server started ("serving on port 5000") but then Vite had an error transforming the modules. This might be a timing issue. Let me check the current workflow status:
Checked logs
Let me read the log file to understand what happened:
Reading log files in detail
The issue is that Vite can't find the path alias during the initial module resolution. This might be because when Vite middleware starts, it's trying to transform modules before the alias resolution is properly set. Let me check if the vite.config has the alias:
Opened vite.config.ts
The vite config has the alias set up correctly. The issue is that Vite is being created with the wrong config. In server/vite.ts, when we spread the viteConfig, we're spreading the function result, not calling it. Let me fix this:
Opened server/vite.ts
The viteConfig is a function, and we need to call it with the mode. Let me fix this:
Edited server/vite.ts
Now let me restart the workflow:
Restarted Start application
Checked system logs
Now the issue is that __dirname is not defined in ES modules. The vite.config.ts is using __dirname but we're importing it as an ES module. Let me fix the vite.config.ts to use import.meta.url:
Edited vite.config.ts
Now let me restart the workflow:
Restarted Start application
Great! The workflow is running. Let me check the logs:
Checked system logs
Excellent! The server is running on port 5000. Let me verify it's working by checking if it responds:
Executed curl -s -I http://localhost:5000 | head -n 3
Perfect! The server is running and responding. Let me update the task list and now configure the deployment settings:
Set up app to run online
Check app works correctly now
Now let me configure the deployment settings. For this full-stack application, I need to set it up for VM deployment since it has a backend server that needs to stay running:
Good! Deployment is configured. Let me check if there are any browser console logs to see if the frontend is working:
Checked console logs
Perfect! The application is running successfully. The frontend is connected to Vite and React Router is working. Now let me update the replit.md documentation and complete the import process:
Prepare app for public use
Now let me update the replit.md with the current configuration:
Edited replit.md
Perfect! Now let me finalize the task list and complete the import process:
Update guide with new settings
Now let me complete the project import by marking it as complete:
